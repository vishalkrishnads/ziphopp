# Contributing to ZipHopp

Since this is a task assigned to me as part of my interview process, this repo is not accepting any contributions as of now. ðŸ™ƒ 
However, I do appreciate you looking to contribute to this app. ðŸ˜„ I have no problems or objections if you want to open a PR, but please note that it won't be merged until the task evaluation is completed by the employer.
Thanks!
