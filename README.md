# `ZipHopp` ðŸ›¸
A desktop app that lists the contents of a ZIP archive, built using the [Tauri framework](https://tauri.app). It lets you select a .zip file from your PC, and lists it's contents by decrypting it. Download the file corresponding to your OS from the [releases page]() to use it right away.

## Problem Statement
In the assigned task, the candidate is required to build a ZIP file viewer that can view the contents of a ZIP file in the system. They are to write it using the [Tauri framework](https://tauri.app). The full document detailing the task can be found [here]() for reference.

### Functionality Required
1. The app should provide a window where the user can click to select and open a ZIP
file.
2. Once a ZIP file is selected, the app should parse the ZIP file and show a tree
showing all the files in the ZIP file (just the path).
3. The app should handle ZIP files locked with a password and ask the user the
password (along with its validation) and then show the files to the user.
4. The app should also show some metadata about the ZIP file itself (name, size,
compressed size etc).
5. The app should have a welcome screen where it remembers and shows the list of
last 5 ZIPs you have opened.

### Constraints & Nuances
1. The ZIP file handling part should be written in Rust.
2. Any frontend JS framework (or even vanilla) can be used to build the frontend/ui
portion of the app.
3. You should use Tauri Commands to communicate back and forth between the UI
and the Rust layer

## Implementation
This section details the implementation of the different functions inside the app for you to understand my thought process better while evaluating. The whole aim here is to get stuff done with minimal code, and I've tried to achieve it in this project.

### ZIP handling
The ZIP handling logic is preformed using Rust at the backend, as stated in the requirements. This however, consists of two parts: i. actually getting a file from the user elegantly, ii. opening & decrpyting the contents of the file itself.

#### Obtaining file from the user
For making the process of selecting a file intuitive and GUI based, I'm using the [`native-dialog::FileDialog`](https://docs.rs/native-dialog/latest/native_dialog/struct.FileDialog.html) to open up a file picker window with a filter to restrict users into choosing only zip archives. The path obtained from the dialog is then used to open the file itself. The relevant code for it can be found in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` in `core::open()`.

```rust
    FileDialog::new()
        .add_filter("ZIP Archive", &["zip"])
        .show_open_single_file()
        .map_err(|e| Error {
            password_required: false,
            path: String::from(""),
            message: e.to_string(),
        })?
```

This code only runs if there is no path provided to `open()`. More about the API itself can be found below in the [API & Communication](#api--communication) section.

#### Decrypting the file
For decrypting the file itself, I'm using the [`zip`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/) crate, which has all the methods required for this application built in. The methods [`by_index()`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/read/struct.ZipArchive.html#method.by_index) & [`by_index_decrypt()`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/read/struct.ZipArchive.html#method.by_index_decrypt) are being used for non-encrypted & password encrypted files respectively. The logic is simple: the backend opens the zip archive, and uses these methods to loop over all files in it. On each iteration, it uses the methods [`compressed_size()`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/read/struct.ZipFile.html#method.compressed_size), [`size()`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/read/struct.ZipFile.html#method.size) & [`name()`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/read/struct.ZipFile.html#method.name) from [`zip::read::ZipFile`](https://docs.rs/zip/latest/zip/read/struct.ZipFile.html) to get it's metadata & name respectively and adds them to the overall result. At last, it just returns the result itself.

> Under the hood, it can be found that both `by_index()` & `by_index_decrypt()` are actually wrappers of a private method `by_index_with_optional_password()` with the following signature:
> ```rust
> fn by_index_with_optional_password<'a>(
>         &'a mut self,
>         file_number: usize,
>         mut password: Option<&[u8]>,
>     ) -> ZipResult<Result<ZipFile<'a>, InvalidPassword>>
> ```
> If this was declared public, there was a way to reduce code even more by directly calling the function and skipping the password checking logic in `open()`, thereby improving performance. But since it isn't, this is what I could come up with.

As such, the method signature of `open()` becomes 
```rust
    pub fn open(
        file: Option<String>, 
        password: Option<String>
    ) -> Result<Success, Error>
```

which can return a `Success` or `Error` state of the open operation. It can take in an optional password & an optional path. You can see more about the front-end API below in the [API & Communication](#api--communication) section.

#### Recent Files
The recently opened files are stored in volatile memory as a queue & in a file in non-volatile memory. Every time there is a change in the queue, the changes are written to disk to prevent data loss. The order of entries in the queue represent the order in which the files were opened by the user. The API exposes a method for the front-end to refresh the recents list, which essentially returns a vector containing all the entries in the file.

If you're wondering why I resorted to using a simple old plain text file for storing the recent file entries, the reason is that introducing a dedicated database in this application seems like a performance overhead & quite frankly, is a bit overkill for this application. Also, in the current implementation, the file itself can be removed from the setup to improve performance while still getting a volatile recents list.

### The UI
The UI itself is written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), which I mostly chose for it's ease of use over vanilla HTML, CSS & JS. Since the task document states that UI polish won't be judged here, I haven't put much care into building a proper UI. As such, if any files with long names are opened in the app, the UI might go haywire and look pretty bad, although none of the functionality will be compromised. Also, if you're a web dev reading the front end code, you 'll find that no best practices like separation of concerns or proper documentation are followed in the front-end code. This is because the task states that the focus is on the Rust code. However, the format of the API is detailed below so that you can understand the communication part better

### API & Communication
The front-end would have to communicate with the back-end for either of 2 purposes: either to open a zip file, or to get a list of all recently opened files. As such, the API exposes two [Tauri Commands](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/command/) for achieving this.

#### Opening files

#### Recents list
